## Welcome to this GitHub Page

My name is Min Hwangbo, 3rd year PhD student at the College of Education, University of Washington. I created this website while I was learning `Rstudio` during my Learning Sciences/Human Development program years (2017 - 2021).

I'm still learning about what's the best way to share and be transparent about what I learned through out my program on this page. 

If you have questions, feel free to `pull` requests or contact me via e-mail foreverm@uw.edu.
