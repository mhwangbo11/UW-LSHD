## Welcome to this GitHub Page

My name is Min Hwangbo, 3rd year PhD student at the College of Education, University of Washington. I created this website while I was learning R during my Learning Sciences/Human Development program years (2017 - 2020), and I'm still learning what's the best way to share what I have learned throughout my program on this page. 

If you have questions, feel free to `pull` requests or contact me via e-mail foreverm@uw.edu
