* Favorite social media platform

## Syllabus
* Using R for analysis/rendering, SPSS for data cleaning/wrangling
* Path -> EFA/CFA -> SRM/SEM -> Advanced i.e. Multi-level modeling
* HW1: Path
* HW2: EFA/CFA
* HW3: SRM/SEM
* Project proposal & presentation
* `Lavaan`
* Pen & Pencil | Laptop only for analysis/data coding
* If needed, Mplus: About $900 for latent(aka *Non-observable*) variable analysis/SEM 
* Book: Get the 4th edition: has a website w/`R` codes

## Methods: Data sample size
* EFA/CFA: Needs at least 6+ variables
* Longitudinal data set: At least 3 time points/checks

## Definition of SEM
* Definition of **Structural equation modeling (SEM)**

> "A Way of representing phenomena using mathematical linear equation of random variables" 

* i.e. [Money] -> (???) -> [Sexy garden]
* ???: Since you have high income, you can afford to hire a gardner, which then will affect the beauty of your garden. This whole process is consider Path modeling.
