Knight (2012) presented the cost of instructional coaching in the 2009-10 school year among four participating schools. 
While Knight (2012) stated the instructional coaching model implemented by the model developers suggested a cost of $2,298 per teacher, the true average cost per teacher at the participating three schools ranged from $3,260 to $5,220. 
Knight (2012) wraped up the article by suggesting careful considerations for evaluating the effectiveness of a coaching framework implemented at a program as one of his major findings was that instructional coaching is 6 to 12 times more expansive than the traditional professional development approach, a one-time group training.
Knight's argument was persuasive enough to acknowledge coaching in general is more expansive than the traditional approach to onboard and prepare teachers to be succesful in the field, yet I wonder without considering the impact and return of coaching, it deemed questionable to state whether coaching is considered expansive or not.
