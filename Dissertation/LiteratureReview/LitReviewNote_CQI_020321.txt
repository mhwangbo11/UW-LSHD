RQ: Are indicators of child care quality associated with higher child care prices, as reported by centerbased providers? 

Goal: "...there is limited information about how the quality of care is related to the prices charged for child care."

Data: data from the 2012 National Survey of Early Care and Education (NSECE), an integrated
set of nationally representative surveys of ECE providers and households with young children.

Sample: 
Level 1 - 3194 ECE providers with at least one child under 60 months of age with reports of unsubsidized program.
Level 2 - 2780 classrooms
Level 3 - 1380 teachers

Summary for me:

"Many other quality indicators, however, did not have significant associations with prices. For example,
ECE centers that help children and their families get services—either on-site or by referral (e.g.,
health screening, developmental assessments, therapeutic services, counseling services, and/or social
services)— do not systematically report higher prices for care than centers that do not offer such
services. And although teachers who report attending workshops in the past year tended to work in
ECE centers that report higher prices, receipt of coaching, mentoring, or ongoing consultation was
unrelated to the reported price in centers" (p.18).

Reflection: There seems to be some indications that if a center provided mentors/coaches/consultants for teachers and instructional staff, some associations were found on center-level indicators of quality 
- Infant: b = 0.28; SE = 0.34 
- Toddler: b = .10; SE = .23
- Preschool: b = .31; SE = 0.24

But I thought if this would be the case y ~ ax | a = beta makes let's say one dosage of coaching (or a program provides coaching), decreases the price of a pre-K program by .31 unit means if the original price of the program was $1, it will be down to .69?
And I am also wondering about how authors have not tried HLM as it seems there's a natural design of the sample that are specified into three different samples?
